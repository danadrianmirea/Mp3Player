# Convention Plugins

Based on the Google [Now in Android](https://github.com/android/nowinandroid/tree/main/build-logic) source code. This project is a placeholder to custom build code than needs to be run in all of the gradle modules.

The plugins are in the root `src/main/kotlin` directory and any custom logic is under the same path as the rest of the app i.e. `com.github.goldy1992.mp3player`
